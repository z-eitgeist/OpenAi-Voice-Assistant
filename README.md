# OpenAi-Voice-Assistant
Integration of OpenAI API with simple voice assistant python script

This is a simple Python script that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to create a voice assistant that can answer your questions.
The script is designed to be run on a local machine, and it requires an OpenAI API key to function properly.

## Getting Started
To get started with this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine, as well as an OpenAI API key. You can sign up for an API key on the OpenAI website.

Once you have your API key, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory in your terminal. Open the script and paste your API key. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:


    pip install -r requirements.txt
After that, you can run the script with the following command:


    python voice_assistant.py
The script will prompt you to enter your OpenAI API key, which you can copy and paste from the OpenAI website.

## Usage
Once the script is running, you can start interacting with Albert the voice assistant by speaking into your computer's microphone. 

To stop the voice assistant give voice command "Exit" or simply press Ctrl+C in your terminal.

## Contributing
If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improving the script, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
